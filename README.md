# VLSI-Design-Laboratory-HDL

This repository contains **Hardware Description Language (HDL) designs** and **FPGA implementation projects** for digital VLSI experiments.  
It is intended for students to learn digital system design using **Verilog/VHDL** and implement them on **FPGA boards**.


## Experiments

**Digital System Design using HDL:**

1. 4-Bit Carry Look Ahead Adder  
2. 4-Bit Booth Multiplier (Time Division Multiplexing)  
3. 8-bit MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) Unit  
4. 8-Bit ALU  
5. 4-Bit Synchronous Up/Down Counter  
6. 4-Bit Universal Shift Register  
7. Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)  
8. Mealy Finite State Machine (FSM)  


## Getting Started

1. Install **Xilinx Vivado / Altera Quartus** or equivalent FPGA synthesis tool.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open the corresponding experiment folder in the FPGA software.  
4. Simulate the HDL design to verify functionality.  
5. Implement and test on the **FPGA Trainer Kit**.


## Requirements

- Xilinx Vivado 2018.3
- Nexys A7-100T FPGA Trainer Kit (Artix-7 XC7A100T)
- Nexys A7-100T Master XDC Constraint File
